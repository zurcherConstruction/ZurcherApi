## For App Review Team

This update introduces a work order management enhancement specifically for field maintenance staff. The WebView component loads forms from our production web server (https://www.zurcherseptic.com) with secure token authentication. This approach allows us to:

1. Maintain consistent forms across mobile and web platforms
2. Update form logic without requiring app updates
3. Ensure data validation occurs server-side
4. Provide a seamless user experience with native navigation

The WebView is strictly limited to our own domain and does not load any third-party content or advertising. All user data remains within our secure infrastructure.

**Privacy Note:** Camera and Photo Library access are only used when the user explicitly chooses to add photos to maintenance forms. No photos are accessed or transmitted without user action.

Thank you for reviewing our app update!
